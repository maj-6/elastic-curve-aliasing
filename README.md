# elastic-curve-aliasing
Applet for visualizing effects of undersampling in discrete approximations of elastic curves

I wrote this in high school to explore some rather beautiful patterns I stumbled across by accident and was extremely curious about. I didn't have enough of a math background to describe them analytically, but I had a fun time using the applet to tweak the parameters and try to empirically figure out what in the world was going on. The term "elastic curve" is a misnomer here, since the path the program traces is defined as a sinusoid function of its arc length rather than its distance from a fixed line.
